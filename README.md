# Description
Dashboard for MakeShip Plushie design approvals. Features:
1. Allow multiple users to login. Sample logins - sukh:sukh, pablo:pablo
2. Upload imags as designs. 
3. Approve / Reject designs. 
4. Read and add new comments. 

# Ways to extend the application further
- Have a dedicated database to store users.
- SSO authentication with passport.js would be more accessible for users. 
- Use React to render parts of the UI in real time and not everything at the same time. The UI also doesn't refresh instantly.
